What You're Aiming For

In this checkpoint, We will see the topics of iterating with async/await, awaiting a call, handling errors with async/await, chaining async/await, awaiting concurrent requests, and awaiting parallel calls:

Choose at least 3 tasks to solve.


Instructions

Task 01:

Iterating with Async/Await: Write an async function iterateWithAsyncAwait that takes an array of values and logs each value with a delay of 1 second between logs.

Task 02:

Awaiting a Call: Create an async function awaitCall that simulates fetching data from an API. Use await to wait for the API response and then log the data.

Task 03:

Handling Errors with Async/Await: Modify the awaitCall function to handle errors gracefully. If the API call fails, catch the error and log a user-friendly error message.

Chaining Async/Await: Write a function chainedAsyncFunctions that calls three separate async functions sequentially. Each function should log a message after a delay of 1 second. Chain these functions using await.

Task 04:

Awaiting Concurrent Requests: Create an async function concurrentRequests that makes two API calls concurrently using Promise.all(). Log the combined results after both requests have resolved.

Task 05:

Awaiting Parallel Calls: Write a function parallelCalls that takes an array of URLs and fetches data from each URL concurrently using Promise.all(). Log the responses once all requests are complete.
